🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a developer. The website is fully responsive and built with modern frontend technologies to ensure a smooth user experience across all devices.
Currently, the frontend is fully implemented, featuring:

🎨 Clean and modern UI/UX design
📱 Fully responsive layout
🧩 Interactive sections for skills, projects, and contact details
The backend integration (for actions like forms, dynamic data, etc.) is in progress and will be added soon.
